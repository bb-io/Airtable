## Introduction

<!-- begin docs -->

Airtable is a cloud-based software platform that combines the functionality of a spreadsheet with the power of a database. It allows users to create, organize, and collaborate on tables of data, similar to a spreadsheet, but with added features such as customizable fields, advanced filtering, linking between tables, attachments, and more.

## Before setting up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that:

- You have an Airtable account.
- You have created a base (database) in your Airtable account.

## Connecting

1. Navigate to apps and search for Airtable. If you cannot find Airtable then click _Add App_ in the top right corner, select Airtable and add the app to your Blackbird environment.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My Airtable connection'.
4. Fill in the Base ID to the base you want to connect in your Airtable instance. In Airtable, each database is called a "base," and each base has a unique identifier known as the "base ID." You can find the base ID in the URL of your Airtable base when you are viewing it in the browser. The base ID is the alphanumeric string that appears after "https://airtable.com/" and before "/base".
5. Click Authorize connection.
6. Follow the instructions from Airtable.
7. When you return to Blackbird, confirm that the connection has appeared and the status is Connected.
